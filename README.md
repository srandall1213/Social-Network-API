# Social-Network-API

## Description
My motivation in completing this project was to apply what I learned this week about NoSQL, mostly MongoDB. I built this project because I wanted to test my skills and see if I could be effective in creating an API for a social network. The Social Network API solves the problem of getting, creating, updating, and deleting thoughts and reactions.
